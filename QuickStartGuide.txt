Quickstart Guide:

1.) Determine your current working directory in Jupyter Notebook
	
	1a.) You know your current working directory: Skip to step 2

	1b.) You do not know your current working directory: Download and run workingdirectory.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
	     This program will give you the directory you need to place the project files into

2.) Place the project files cardtable.db and 2018PythonProject.ipynb (unzipped) into the current working directory

3.) Open and run 2018PythonProject.ipynb: This will run the script and give a box plot of the various lengths of flavor
    text on each card by color. It will also modify database cardtable.db as described in README.md
